# C9 Starter Child Theme
The C9 Starter Child Theme works with the C9 Theme as its parent. If you're more comfortable developing from within a child theme versus using the [client folder](https://c9.covertnine.com/documentation/c9-client-boilerplate/) as we outline on the [online documentation](https://c9.covertnine.com/documentation/), then this child theme will queue up everything you need so your theme changes are not overwritten during theme updates.

If you want to make the C9 Theme customized for a client site, we recommend making use of the client folder within the parent theme.
